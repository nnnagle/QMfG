Data are facts and observations about the world. We're geographers and we care about the world, and so we care about data.
Data can be qualitative, like your field notes where you record your impressions, or data can be quantitative, like the number of rings you've counted in a wood core cut from a tree, or the income of a household.

But, while data are facts, that does not mean that the facts are obviously understood.
